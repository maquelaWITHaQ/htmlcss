                <h2>It's Not Just Going To School. It's Learning Life.</h2>
                    <p>The Patino School of Entrepreneurship  is a new model for secondary education. It's an applied entrepreneurship school that fosters real world skills - critical thinking, problem solving, and collaboration - and as seniors, students launch their own companies.</p>
                    <div class="spotlight">
                <h2>Thinking Outside The Box</h2>
                    <p>As a foundation for learning, students begin mastering technology: computer literacy, web navigation, website creation, online marketing and coding. By graduation, students will have developed, pitched, and started their own business, and in the process will have learned valuable life and career skills, including working in teams, thinking critically, analyzing data, leading, navigating technology, prioritizing, making decisions, and negotiating. Students learn to work hard, think outside of the boundaries, be team players, and not be afraid to try new things.</p>
